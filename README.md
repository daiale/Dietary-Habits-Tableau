 An Exploration of Diet Habits

I found this dataset on Kaggle and thought it would be a good dataset to use to explore what people different kind of diets are and what relations do they have in your life. After profiling the data, I took the raw data into excel and made sure to clean it. In this repository you will find the excel I cleaned my data on. I then took the data in to Tableau to create a dashboard to visualize and further understand the data. The link to the dashboard and raw datasetd will be linked below.

	In this dashboard we explore the different connections between our diet, well-being, and overall lifestyle. There are a lot of insights you can gather from the data but I am going to name a few I have gathered:

Gender can be a big influence in what we eat and influence how often weâ€™re eating out. The dashboard shows a count of genders by diet and which on those diets frequent towards eating out or staying in. This can be used to explore the affect a diet has on how and what audience restaurants can focus on to meet business demands.

Allergies can also be a big factor for someone when choosing a diet. I wanted to be able to explore what that relationship looks like with a distinct count of allergies to see if the relation in diet is due to avoid those specific allergens or to see if allergens play a role at all.

The last thing i wanted to see was the relationship between peoples diet and knowledge of how their diet is working for them. You can explore what diet types are more often to visit a nutritionist or dietician, while being bale to filter for specific age groups as well. Was there a specific group with high consultation activity and could it be because of age, diet, or habits withing the diet?

I loved using this dataset to build one of my very first projects and I also wanted to thank you for taking the time to view it! I would love any feedback if you would love to offer it. Thank you for allowing me to take you through the data exploration of different diet habits and there affects in relation to our lifestyle.
